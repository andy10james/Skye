Originally to support Neural project's web server interface, windows.js is a JavaScript library, focused on adding a cascading and fully functional panel / 'windows' interface easily to a developer's webpages. This will include vast customisation options for the developer, and will be released open-source. 

Currently working towards version 1.0.0 (Mercury);

### How do I get set up? ###

* windows.js works on the latest JQuery, to get jQuery visit http://jquery.com/
* Add both windows.js and windows.js.css into your HTML
* Your ready to go, everything you need is in the Windows namespace; go ahead and try Windows.create();

```
