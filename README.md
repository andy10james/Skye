Skye is the unique JavaScript library, enabling developers to easily create agile interface panels (known as Skyes) to their interfaces. Skye has come on a long journey in its development, it has seen many faces and trials, however, now with it's flexibility in customisation and a highly robust feature set, I hope you find developing with Skye as much fun as I found developing for it!
